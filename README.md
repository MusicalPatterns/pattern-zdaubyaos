# Zdaubyaos

fun with the superparticular series & variants, plus stepwise motion within recurring bounds

## styles

**zdaub**: melodic; inherited from stepwise

**yaos**: rhythmic; inherited from oumaotcou'ao'iest

Each of these styles has its own Blocks and Renderings which create Contours mostly of length either 15 or 24. 

## development notes

`zdaubyaos` is currently the only pattern which imports another pattern. I believe this should become a common good practice, but for now, you're my guinea pig.

It imports `xenharmonic-series` for the scales it uses.

I've noticed this can cause hiccups when refactoring across Musical Patterns and all patterns need to be updated.
If you have a script iterating over all the pattern repos, it may fail on `zdaubyaos` because it won't be able to compile without the latest format of code from `xenharmonic series` 
(and because the latter immediately precedes the former alphabetically, often the code it has just shipped is not yet available).
